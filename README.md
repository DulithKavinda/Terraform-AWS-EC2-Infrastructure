# ☁️ Terraform AWS EC2 Infrastructure (Dev Environment)

This project sets up a basic **AWS cloud infrastructure** using **Terraform**. It's designed as a foundational DevOps project that provisions a complete environment to host a public EC2 instance.



## 🚀 What It Does

* Creates a **custom VPC** with DNS support
* Sets up a **public subnet** in a specific availability zone
* Configures an **internet gateway** and route table for internet access
* Launches an **Ubuntu EC2 instance**
* Generates an **SSH configuration file** to easily connect to the instance
* Attaches a **security group** that allows all inbound/outbound traffic *(for development purposes only)*



##  Technologies Used

* **Terraform** (\~> 5.0)
* **AWS** (VPC, EC2, Subnet, Internet Gateway, Security Group)
* **Ubuntu 24.04 AMI**
* **PowerShell / Local-Exec Provisioner**

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following set up **(locally or in GitHub Codespaces)**:

*  **AWS CLI** configured with a profile named `VScode`
*  **Terraform** installed (`terraform -version`)
*  An **SSH key pair** (e.g., `~/.ssh/mtckey` and `~/.ssh/mtckey.pub`)
*  An **AWS account** with permissions to create EC2, VPC, Subnet, etc.





##  How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-aws-ec2-dev.git
cd terraform-aws-ec2-dev
```

### 2. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 3. Review the Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 4. Apply the Infrastructure

```bash
terraform apply
```

### 5. Connect to EC2

After deployment, the `ssh-config.tpl` will generate a config entry like:

```bash
Host dev-node
  HostName <ec2-public-ip>
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mtckey
```

Then connect via:

```bash
ssh dev-node
```

### 6. Destroy Resources

To clean up and destroy all the provisioned resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
